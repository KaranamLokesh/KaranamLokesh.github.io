# **About Me**

Hi! My name is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:<br>
I am a first-yearMasters student in the Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at the <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://missouri.edu/'>University of Missouri</a>. My research interests include machine learning, data science, and computer vision. I am particularly interested in research that explores how geometric learning algorithms coupled with the predictive power of deep neural networks can be used to create innovative applications in computational biology, computer vision, and natural language processing. Previously, I received my Integrated Post Graduate degree in Information technology from ABV-Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management, Gwalior.
